# DeeProkedekt
The second version of Prokedekt, which used Deep Learning to recognize text from textboxes, which are detected from an image using EAST Detector. 

## Tasks:
* The [dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/) used for training.
* Clean the dataset.
* Convert images to np arrays of the same size.
* Create ground truth file (output layer)
* Create train/dev/test sets. 
* Make minibatches of train set. 
* Learn Keras to build a basic CNN.
* Train it and check results on the test set. 
* Document the results of different models and choose the best working model. (CNN, RNN, Adam, ResNet, Inception, etc)
* Fine tune hyperparameters.
